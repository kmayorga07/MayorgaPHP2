# MayorgaPHP2
You will be using html, css, PHP, and MySQL to access data.

What should you expect:
1) When you start the program you are greeted with the title of the program.
2) All you have to do is enter a city in the text box, and click the button below.
3) index.php will access cust_city.php which will use PHP to access the database of customers within a city.
4) If the city does not exist within the database, you will get a blank screen. Also if the database does not exist, the program will output the contents of database_error.php.
5) The results will then display the customers within a city you entered.
6) Enjoy and leave a star, thumbs up :)
